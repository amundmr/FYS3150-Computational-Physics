\begin{abstract}
This report adresses the Ising model applied to a ferro-magnetic crystal in two dimensions, consisting of electron-spins in one of two states. We calculate, both analytically and numerically, the expected energy, magnetization, heat capacity susceptibility and critical temperature - all the while paying attention to numerical efficiency. The results are satisfactory and the computation is parallelizable, which keeps it from becoming too time intensive.
