\section{Conclusion}
The Ising model does a great job of simulating a ferrous material. The results correspond well with analytical calculations. We showed what amount of Monte Carlo cycles you would need to stabilize such a system, and even though the calculations are time consuming, we are able to keep the calculation time down with parallelization. We also showed that the critical temperature for a system like this approaches $T_C = 2.261$, which is very close to Lars Onsager's result.
