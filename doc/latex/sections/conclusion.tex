\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
From the tables presented in the results section one can simply compare the different methods applied. It seems for the Quadtrature methods that a higher number for integrsation points,N, beyond what discussed in the results(N> 11), does not yield better results.  THE REASON:
Comparing Legandre with Laguerre there is a seginficant improvment in presition, but not least in stability when increasing N.
