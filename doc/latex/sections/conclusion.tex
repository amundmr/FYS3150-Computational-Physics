\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Using Newtonian mechanics coupled with the Velocity Verlet integration method to simulate the solar system gives convincing results. Velocity Verlet being the preferred method is further backed by testing its efficiency against Euler Forward and it has the advantage of conserving the energy of the simulated solar system, as well as provably being stable. We've also found the model can handle addition of relativistic effects and consider this report successful.
