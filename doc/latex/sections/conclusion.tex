\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
From the tables presented in the results section one can simply compare the different methods applied. It seems for the quadrature methods that a higher number of integration points $N$ - beyond whats discussed in the results($N> 11$) - does not yield better results. % reason here
Comparing Legandre with Laguerre there is a significant improvement in precision, not least in stability with increasing $N$.
