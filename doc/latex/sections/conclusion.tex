\section{Conclusion}
The Ising model does a great job of simulating a ferrous material. We showed what amount of Monte Carlo cycles you would need to stabilize such a system, and even though there are many calculations which takes alot of time, we are able to keep the calculation times down with parallelization. We also showed that the critical temperature for a system like this approaces $T_C = 2.261$, which is very close to Lars Onsagers result.
