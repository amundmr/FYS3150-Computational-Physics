\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Development in methods for solving integrals has been important in order to solve problems with a increasing degree of complexety. Guassian quadrature is a good example which is a method first developed by Jacobi in 1676. The first version gave exact results for algebraic polynomials of negree n-1 or less. The "new" Guassian version has a significant increase in accuaracy with exact results for polynomials of degree 2n-1 or less due to free choise of weights.

Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Laguerre are two types of Guassian quadrature  which, togheter with the well known Monte Carlo method, will be compared in accuaracy and speed for a multidimensional integral for a Helium atom.

Some theory is first presented with a following discussion of the three methodes mentioned above.
