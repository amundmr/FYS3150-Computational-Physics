\section{Introduction}
The Ising model is a statistical model of ferromagnetism. Modelling the atomic spins as discrete values ($\pm 1$), the model can identify phase transitions for a periodically repeating crystal of said spins interracting with its neighbours. In this way, the model is also relevant in other studies - modelling the way networks evolve in for example neuroscience and elections. \\
In this report, we will study the Ising model by applying it to a two-dimensional lattice of spins, with two allowable states. Analytical values are first found for comparison, followed by numerical moddeling utilizing the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm.
