\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
The Verlet method is a widely used method for solving coupled ordinary differential equations. This method will be implemented  in order to make a simulation of our solarsystem.  Due to several coupled ordinary differential equations it is nessecary to use object oriented code where the planets orbit is calculated using the Verlet method with different initial conditions for the different planets. This way of coding makes it easier to expand the algoritm if it is desirble to add more planets, moons og astronomical objects in the system. The equations used to calculate the movement of the planets is Newtons low of gravity and Newtons second law. Due to the suns enourmus mass, its moiton will be negligible compared with the other planets.
