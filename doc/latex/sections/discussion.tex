\subsection{Testing}
As we can se from section \ref{sec:results-test-timestep}, the Verlet method is quite stable. Even with a step length of $0.02$ years, we see that the orbit for the first thousand years is still quite good. However, with greater steplengths the calculations soon become inreliable.

From results \ref{sec:results-test-conservation} we see that both the kinetic and potential energy is constant over time, thus it is conserved. Since these values are constant, the angular momentum must also be constant, since it only depends on distance, speed and mass.
