abstract = {In order to define Monte Carlo integration, we start by reviewing some basic ideas from probability. A.1.1 Random Variables A random variable X is a function that maps outcomes of a random process to numbers. A random variable can be either discrete (e.g., the roll of a six-sided die where a fixed set of outcomes is possible, X = {\{}1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6{\}}), or continuous (e.g., a person's height, which can take on real values R). In computer graphics we more commonly deal with continuous random variables which take on values over ranges of continuous domains (e.g., the real numbers R or the sphere of directions Ω). A.1.2 Cumulative Distributions and Density Functions The cumulative distribution function, or CDF, of a random variable X is the probability that a value chosen from the variable's distribution is less than or equal to some thresold x: cd f (x) = P r {\{}X ≤ x{\}}. (A.1) The corresponding probability density function, or PDF, is the derivative of the CDF: pd f (x) = d d x cd f (x). (A.2) CDFs are always monotonically increasing, which means that the PDF is always non-negative. An important relationship arises from the above two equations, which allows us to compute the probability that a random variable lies within an interval: P r {\{}a ≤ X ≤ b{\}} = b a pd f (x) dx.
