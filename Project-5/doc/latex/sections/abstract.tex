\begin{abstract}
This report aims to portray a convincing computational model of our solar system, based on basic Newtonian laws of gravitation. Key theory is explained, as well as our approach to making an object oriented simulation of all the solar system's bodies. Following this, we test important aspects of the model: the preferred integration method, the time step dependency, the computational efficiency, energy conservation, which origin to use and how our model handles relativity. The finalized model is convincing and gives satisfactory results on the tests mentioned above.
