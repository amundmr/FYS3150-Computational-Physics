## Testing effect of Iteration points and infinity approximation

You can choose either to test how different approximations of $\rho_{max}$ changes the time spent, and the error, or test how different number of integration points, N, changes time and error.

To compile code for N-testing, edit the makefile to compile main.cpp.
To compile code for $\rho_{max}$-testing, edit the makefile to compile main_rho.cpp
