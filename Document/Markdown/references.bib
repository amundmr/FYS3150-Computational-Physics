The original source codes are taken from the widely used software package LAPACK, which follows two other popular packages developed in the 1970s, namely EISPACK and LINPACK. • LINPACK: package for linear equations and least square problems. • LAPACK:package for solving symmetric, unsymmetric and generalized eigenvalue problems. From LAPACK's website http://www.netlib.org it is possible to download for free all source codes from this library. Both C/C++ and Fortran versions are available. • BLAS (I, II and III): (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Blas I is vector operations, II vector-matrix operations and III matrix-matrix operations. Highly parallelized and efficient codes, all available for download from},
